# Git Typing

I love the idea of [typing.io](https://typing.io/), instead of typing random paragraphs, why not typing code from real projects.

## Usage

Choose Github's repo you want to typing, then choose one file. Replacing ```github.com/``` by ```gittyping.vercel.app/?github=```, and enjoy.

Note: *This app use indexedDB to store data so your config, which you already typing will be there when you back.*
